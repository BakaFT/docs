# JavaScript Plugin

Plugin development requires basic knowledge of
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) if you want to make a
theme. It's pretty easy if you're already familiar with web programming.

## Creating a plugin

Suppose your new plugin name is `your-plugin`.

First, you need to create a new folder called `your-plugin` in the **plugins**
folder (inside the Pengu Loader root folder).

```
root/
  |__plugins/
    |__@default/        <- the default plugin
      |...
    |__your-plugin/     <- your new plugin
      |__index.js       <- plugin entry
```

Then create a new file called `index.js` in your plugin folder. This index is an
entry point for your plugin which will be executed when the League Client is
ready. Now you can open it in any editor and start coding.

::: tip

We recommend that you use modern JavaScript editors such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to develop your plugins, as
it supports intellisense, linter and code auto-completion.

:::

Next, just add this line to the index and save it.

```js
console.log('Hello, League Client!')
```

::: info

All your code/text files should be saved in UTF-8 encoding (no BOM). If not,
your plugin won't work as expected.

:::

Then launch your League Client, and when the Client is ready, try pressing
`Ctrl Shift I` key to open **Chrome DevTools**. Navigate to the **Console** tab
in the DevTools and scroll to the top, you will see the output message.

```
Hello, League Client!
```
