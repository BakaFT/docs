## Why JavaScript?

</p>

**JavaScript** is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely
used in web development. It has become the de facto standard for client-side
scripting on the web, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web
pages.

The main advantage of JavaScript is its compatibility with the League Client Ux,
which is actually an embedded Chromium web browser. This means that JavaScript
plugins can be easily integrated into the client and run seamlessly alongside
the existing client code. In addition, users can leverage the full power of the
Chrome DevTools to debug and modify their plugins.

In the case of Pengu Loader, JavaScript provides an ideal platform for
customizing the League of Legends Client. By using JavaScript plugins, users can
add new functionality, change the look and feel of the client, and even
integrate web-based technologies into the client interface. Because JavaScript
is a widely-used language with a large community of developers, there are many
existing tools and libraries that can be leveraged to enhance the functionality
of Pengu Loader.
